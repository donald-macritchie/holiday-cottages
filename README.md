#### test_create_cottage

- In test_create_cottage, it is testing the creation of the cottage object.

- assertIsInstance is checking if the "cottage" object is an instance of the "Cottage" class.
- self.assertTrue(cottage.name.startswith('Test')): This assertion checks if the name attribute of the cottage object starts with the string 'Test'.
- self.assertIn('unittests', cottage.description): This assertion checks if the string 'unittests' is found within the description attribute of the cottage object.

### Views Tests

- TestHomesteadCottageView has been implemented to homestead_cottage view.

``` python
class TestHomesteadCottageView(unittest.TestCase):
    def setUp(self):
        self.client = Client()

    # Tests if the view returns a 200 status

    def test_homestead_cottage_view(self):
        response = self.client.get(reverse('homestead_cottage'))

        self.assertEqual(response.status_code, 200)

    # Test if the context data is passed to the template
    def test_homestead_cottage_context(self):
        response = self.client.get(reverse('homestead_cottage'))
        homestead_cottage = response.context['homestead_cottage']

        self.assertEqual(homestead_cottage.name, 'Homestead')


if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()
```

### Forms Test

- TestBookingForm has been implemented to test the Booking form.

```python
class TestBookingForm(unittest.TestCase):


    # Test if the form is valid when all fields have correct data
    def test_valid_form(self):
        data = {
            'check_in_date': '31/12/2023',
            'check_out_date': '02/01/2024',
            'number_of_guests': 2,
            'guest_name': 'John Doe',
        }
        form = BookingForm(data=data)
        self.assertTrue(form.is_valid())


    # Test if the form is invalid when fields have missing or incorrect data 
    def test_invalid_form(self):
        data = {
            'check_in_date': '31/12/2023',
            'check_out_date': '02/01/2022',
            'number_of_guests': '',
            'guest_name': 'John Doe',
        }
        form = BookingForm(data=data)
        self.assertFalse(form.is_valid())

    # Test if the date widgets render as expected
    def test_widgets(self):
        form = BookingForm()
        self.assertIn('type="date"', str(form['check_in_date']))
        self.assertIn('type="date"', str(form['check_out_date']))


    # Test if the form is correctly saving to the data to the model
    def test_save_to_model(self):
        data = {
            'check_in_date': '31/12/2023',
            'check_out_date': '02/01/2024',
            'number_of_guests': 2,
            'guest_name': 'John Doe',
        }

        form = BookingForm(data=data)
        self.assertTrue(form.is_valid())
        booking = form.save(commit=False)
        self.assertEqual(booking.check_in_date, date(2023, 12, 31))
        self.assertEqual(booking.check_out_date, date(2024, 1, 2))
        self.assertEqual(booking.number_of_guests, 2)
        self.assertEqual(booking.guest_name, 'John Doe')


    if __name__ == '__main__':
        unittest.main()
```

#### test_valid_form

- Test that the form is valid when all fields are filled with correct data.

#### test_invalid_form

- Test that the form is invalid when required fields are missing or contain incorrect data.
  
#### test_widgets

- Test if the date widgets render as expected

#### test_save_to_model

- Test if the form is correctly saving to the data to the model
